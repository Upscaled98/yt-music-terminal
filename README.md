# YT Music Terminal
This project is a terminal application for YT Music using the curses library.
It will eventually have a UI that you'll be able to navigate through.

## How to build?
You can build the app by creating a virtual environment and installing the packages using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## What can it do so far?
At the moment I have a basic system for navigating between sections of the application.
I also am in the process of making the home screen UI.
It can connect to your Google Account to log you into YT Music.
